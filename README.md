### Project Description
The **Wedding Venue Reservation Website** allows users to browse and book wedding venues based on availability, location, and other preferences. It enables customers to easily reserve their desired venue, manage bookings, and get in touch with venue owners for any custom requests or inquiries. The platform simplifies the event planning process by providing an intuitive interface for venue selection and reservation management.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Couples struggle to find and book wedding venues due to scattered information and time-consuming coordination. Availability issues and lack of direct communication with venue owners often lead to confusion and missed opportunities.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Wedding Venue Reservation Website centralizes venue information, allowing users to easily search, filter, and book venues in real-time. It also enables direct communication with venue owners and offers booking management, simplifying the planning process.
